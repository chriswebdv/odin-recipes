        <h2>Yummy Cuban Medianoche!</h2>
        <p>This is one of the more famous sandwiches straight out of the island of Cuba. 
        This recipe came from my uncle who used to work at a restaurant in Pinar del Rio, 
        Cuba and now works at a Cuban cafeteria here in Miami. This sandwich is best served 
        with fried plantain chips and a cold mamey milkshake!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 sweet bread rolls</li>
                <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
                <li>¼ cup prepared mustard</li>
                <li>1 pound thinly sliced cooked ham</li>
                <li>1 pound thinly sliced fully cooked pork</li>
                <li>1 pound sliced Swiss cheese</li>
                <li>1 cup dill pickle slices</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Split the sandwich rolls in half, and spread mustard and mayonnaise liberally onto the cut sides.</li>
                <li>On each sandwich, place and equal amount of Swiss cheese, ham and pork in exactly that order. Place a few pickles onto each one, and put the top of the roll onto the sandwich. Brush the tops with melted butter.</li>
                <li>Press each sandwich in a sandwich press heated to medium-high heat. If a sandwich press is not available, use a large skillet over medium-high heat, and press the sandwiches down using a sturdy plate or skillet. Some indoor grills may be good for this also. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, keeping sandwiches pressed. If using a skillet, you may want to flip them once for even browning. Slice diagonally and serve hot.</li>
